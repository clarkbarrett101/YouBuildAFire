        Day had broken cold and grey. The man ventured through a little-traveled Yukon trail. He was unfazed by the sun
        being absent from the sky, it had been days since he had last seen the sun. The mystery of it all, including the
        tremendous cold, made no impression on the man. It was not because he was long used to it. He was a new-comer in
        the land and this was his first winter. He was skilled and alert but lacked imagination. To him, 70 below 0 was
        simply 70 below. He never stopped to consider the frailty of his creature or how cold affects the mind. He
        remembered the advice of the old-timer on Sulphur Creek, and smiled. The old-timer had been very serious in
        laying down the law that no man must travel alone in the Klondike after fifty below. The man was convinced he
        had grown paranoid in his old age. All a man had to do was to keep his head, and he was all right. Any man who
        was a man could travel alone.
        But the temperature did not matter. He was bound for the old claim on the left fork of Henderson Creek, where
        the boys were already. He would be in to camp by six o’clock; a bit after dark, it was true, but the boys would
        be there, a fire would be going, and a hot supper would be ready. As for lunch, he pressed his hand against the
        protruding bundle under his jacket. He smiled agreeably to himself as he thought of those biscuits, each cut
        open and sopped in bacon grease, and each enclosing a generous slice of fried bacon.
        At the man’s heels trotted a dog, a big native husky, the proper wolf-dog, grey-coated and without any visible
        or temperamental difference from its brother, the wild wolf. The animal was depressed by the tremendous cold. It
        knew that it was no time for travelling. Its instinct told it a truer tale than was told to the man by the man’s
        judgment. The dog did not know anything about thermometers. It experienced a vague but menacing apprehension
        that made it question eagerly every unwonted movement of the man as if expecting him to build a fire. The dog
        had learned fire, and it wanted fire, or else to burrow under the snow and cuddle its warmth away from the air.
        Half-past twelve, to the minute, he arrived at the forks of the creek. He was pleased at the speed he had made.
        If he kept it up, he would certainly be with the boys by six.
        Famished from fatigue, he considered using this time to rest and eat his lunch. He would expend his limited day
        light for much needed stamina and warmth.
    </div>
    <div id="1" hidden>
        <br>
        He sat down on a snow-covered log to eat.
        <br>
        <br>
        He got out matches and proceeded to make a fire. Working carefully from a small beginning, he soon had a roaring
        fire, and in the protection of which he ate his biscuits. For the moment the cold of space was outwitted. The
        dog took satisfaction in the fire, stretching out close enough for warmth and far enough away to escape being
        singed. Then he pulled on his mittens, settled the ear-flaps of his cap firmly about his ears, and took the
        creek trail up the left fork. The dog was disappointed and yearned back toward the fire. This man did not know
        cold. The dog made no effort to communicate its apprehension to the man. It was not concerned in the welfare of
        the man; it was for its own sake that it yearned back toward the fire.
    </div>
    <div id="2" hidden>
        <br>
        He kept his brisk pace.
        <br>
        <br>
        The creek he knew was frozen clear to the bottom—no creek could contain water in that arctic winter—but he knew
        also that there were springs that bubbled out from the hillsides and ran along under the snow and on top the ice
        of the creek. He knew that the coldest snaps never froze these springs, and he knew likewise their danger. They
        were traps. They hid pools of water under the snow that might be three inches deep, or three feet. Sometimes a
        skin of ice half an inch thick covered them, and in turn was covered by the snow. Sometimes there were alternate
        layers of water and ice-skin, so that when one broke through he kept on breaking through for a while, sometimes
        wetting himself to the waist. In the light he spotted signs of these traps.
        He considered having the dog walk in front of him to test the ground. Should there be any ice traps, the dog
        would be plunged into the water instead of him.
    </div>
    <div id="3" hidden>
        <br>
        He called the dog to follow at his heels.
        <br>
        <br>
        And then it happened. At a place where there were no signs, where the soft, unbroken snow seemed to advertise
        solidity beneath, the man broke through. It was not deep. He wetted himself half-way to the knees before he
        floundered out to the firm crust. He was angry, and cursed his luck aloud. He had hoped to get into camp with
        the boys at six o’clock, and this would delay him an hour, for he would have to build a fire and dry out his
        foot-gear. He knew there must be no failure. When it is seventy-five below zero, a man must not fail in his
        first attempt to build a fire—that is, if his feet are wet. If his feet are dry, and he fails, he can run along
        the trail for half a mile and restore his circulation. But the circulation of wet and freezing feet cannot be
        restored by running when it is seventy-five below. No matter how fast he runs, the wet feet will freeze the
        harder.
        He first instinct was to build the fire in a mossy clearing, safe from the elements. But he also saw a spot in
        the trees with plenty of brittle kindling in the area.
    </div>
    <div id="4" hidden>
        <br><br>
        And all the time, in his consciousness, was the knowledge that each instant his feet were freezing. This
        thought tended to put him in a panic, but he fought against it and kept calm. Perhaps the old-timer on Sulphur
        Creek was right. If he had only had a trail-mate he would have been in no danger now. The trail-mate could have
        built the fire. Every second he went without a fire, the more of his body was freezing.

    <div id="6" hidden>
        <br>
        Next he brought out his bunch of sulphur matches.
        <br>
        <br>
        But the tremendous cold had already driven the life out of his fingers. In his effort to separate one match from
        the others, the whole bunch fell in the snow. The dead fingers could neither touch nor clutch. He drove the
        thought of his freezing feet; and nose, and cheeks, out of his mind, devoting his whole soul to the matches. He
        watched, using the sense of vision in place of touch, and when he saw his fingers on each side the bunch, he
        closed them—that is, he willed to close them, for the wires were drawn, and the fingers did not obey. Then, with
        both mittened hands, he scooped the bunch of matches, along with much snow, into his lap. Yet he was no better
        off.
    </div>
    <div id="7" hidden>
        <br>
        He began threshing his arms back and forth, beating the mittened hands against his sides.
        <br>
        <br>
        He did this for five minutes, violently, and his heart pumped enough blood up to the surface to put a stop to
        his shivering. But no sensation was aroused in the hands. He had an impression that they hung like weights on
        the ends of his arms, but when he tried to run the impression down, he could not find it.
    </div>
    <div id="8" hidden>
        <br>
        He tried fumbling them into his mouth.
        <br>
        <br>
        After some manipulation he managed to get the bunch between the heels of his mittened hands. In this fashion he
        carried it to his mouth. He picked it up in his teeth and scratched it on his leg. Twenty times he scratched
        before he succeeded in lighting it. As it flamed he held it with his teeth to the birch-bark. But the burning
        brimstone went up his nostrils and into his lungs, causing him to cough spasmodically. The match fell into the
        snow and went out.
    </div>
    <div id="9" hidden>
        <br>
        Suddenly he bared both hands, removing the mittens with his teeth.
        <br>
        <br>
        His arm-muscles not being frozen enabled him to press the hand-heels tightly against the matches. Then he
        scratched the bunch along his leg. It flared into flame, all seventy sulphur matches at once! As he held the
        blazing bunch to the birch-bark, he became aware of sensation in his hand. His flesh was burning. He could smell
        it. The sensation developed into pain that grew acute. At last, when he could endure no more, he jerked his
        hands apart. The blazing matches fell sizzling into the snow, but the birch-bark was alight.
    </div>
    <div id="10" hidden>
        <br>
        Small pieces of rotten wood and green moss clung to the twigs, and he bit them off as well as he could with his
        teeth. He cherished the flame carefully and awkwardly. A large piece of green moss fell squarely on the little
        fire. He tried to poke it out with his fingers, but his shivering frame made him poke too far, and he disrupted
        the nucleus of the little fire, the burning grasses and tiny twigs separating and scattering. He tried to poke
        them together again, but in spite of the tenseness of the effort, his shivering got away with him, and the twigs
        were hopelessly scattered.
    </div>
    <div id="11" hidden>
        <br>
        Now the tree under which he had done this carried a weight of snow on its boughs. This fell on the boughs
        beneath, capsizing them. It grew like an avalanche, and it descended without warning upon the man and the fire,
        and the fire was blotted out! Where it had burned was a mantle of fresh and disordered snow.
    </div>
    <div id="12" hidden>
        A certain fear of death, dull and oppressive, came to him. This fear quickly became poignant as he realized
        that it was no longer a mere matter of freezing his fingers and toes, or of losing his hands and feet, but that
        it was a matter of life and death with the chances against him.
    </div>
    <div id="13" hidden>
        <br>
        Suspecting danger, he compelled the dog to go on in front.
        <br>
        <br>
        The dog did not want to go. It hung back until the man shoved it forward, and then it went quickly across the
        white, unbroken surface. Suddenly it broke through, floundered to one side, and got away to firmer footing. It
        had wet its forefeet and legs, and almost immediately the water that clung to it turned to ice. It made quick
        efforts to lick the ice off its legs, then dropped down in the snow and began to bite out the ice that had
        formed between the toes. This was a matter of instinct. To permit the ice to remain would mean sore feet. It did
        not know this. He removed the mitten from his right hand and helped tear out the ice-particles. He did not
        expose his fingers more than a minute, and was astonished at the swift numbness that smote them. It certainly
        was cold. He pulled on the mitten hastily, and beat the hand savagely across his chest.
        The man looked down at his hands in order to locate them, and found them hanging on the ends of his arms. It
        struck him as curious that one should have to use his eyes in order to find out where his hands were. He began
        threshing his arms back and forth, beating the mittened hands against his sides. He did this for five minutes,
        violently, and his heart pumped enough blood up to the surface to put a stop to his shivering. But no sensation
        was aroused in the hands. He had an impression that they hung like weights on the ends of his arms, but when he
        tried to run the impression down, he could not find it.
        Without his hands it would be impossible to build a fire. Perhaps the old-timer on Sulphur Creek was right. If
        he had only had a trail-mate he would have been in no danger now. The trail-mate could have built the fire.
        A certain fear of death, dull and oppressive, came to him. This fear quickly became poignant as he realized that
        it was no longer a mere matter of freezing his fingers and toes, or of losing his hands and feet, but that it
        was a matter of life and death with the chances against him. This threw him into a panic, and he turned and ran
        up the creek-bed along the old, dim trail. The dog joined in behind and kept up with him. The sight of the dog
        put a wild idea into his head. He remembered the tale of the man, caught in a blizzard, who killed a steer and
        crawled inside the carcass, and so was saved.
    </div>
    <div id="14" hidden>
        <br>
        He ran blindly, without intention, in fear such as he had never known in his life.
        <br>
        <br>
        The running made him feel better. He did not shiver. Maybe, if he ran on, his feet would thaw out; and, anyway,
        if he ran far enough, he would reach camp and the boys. Without doubt he would lose some fingers and toes and
        some of his face; but the boys would take care of him, and save the rest of him when he got there. And at the
        same time there was another thought in his mind that said he would never get to the camp and the boys; that it
        was too many miles away, that the freezing had too great a start on him, and that he would soon be stiff and
        dead. This thought he kept in the background and refused to consider.
        It struck him as curious that he could run at all on feet so frozen that he could not feel them when they struck
        the earth and took the weight of his body. He seemed to himself to skim along above the surface and to have no
        connection with the earth.
        His theory of running until he reached camp and the boys had one flaw in it: he lacked the endurance. Several
        times he stumbled, and finally he tottered, crumpled up, and fell. When he tried to rise, he failed. Running
        would not thaw his hands and feet. Once he slowed down to a walk, but the thought of the freezing extending
        itself made him run again.
    </div>
    <div id="15" hidden>
        <br>
        He decided he must lunge at the dog with his knife
        <br>
        <br>
        He would kill the dog and bury his hands in the warm body until the numbness went out of them. Then he could
        build a fire. He spoke to the dog, calling it to him; but in his voice was a strange note of fear that
        frightened the animal, who had never known the man to speak in such way before. Something was the matter, and
        its suspicious nature sensed danger,—it knew not what danger but somewhere, somehow, in its brain arose an
        apprehension of the man. It flattened its ears down at the sound of the man’s voice, and its restless, hunching
        movements and the liftings and shiftings of its forefeet became more pronounced but it would not come to the
        man. He got on his hands and knees and crawled toward the dog. This unusual posture again excited suspicion, and
        the animal sidled mincingly away.
    </div>
    <div id="16" hidden>
        <br>
        He decided he must trick the dog and then strangle it.
        <br>
        <br>
        The man sat up in the snow for a moment and struggled for calmness. Then he pulled on his mittens, by means of
        his teeth, and got upon his feet. He glanced down at first in order to assure himself that he was really
        standing up, for the absence of sensation in his feet left him unrelated to the earth. As it came within
        reaching distance, the man lost his control. His arms flashed out to the dog, and he experienced genuine
        surprise when he discovered that his hands could not clutch, that there was neither bend nor feeling in the
        lingers. He had forgotten for the moment that they were frozen and that they were freezing more and more. All
        this happened quickly, and before the animal could get away, he encircled its body with his arms. He sat down in
        the snow, and in this fashion held the dog, while it snarled and whined and struggled. He realized that he could
        not kill the dog. There was no way to do it. With his helpless hands he could neither draw nor hold his
        sheath-knife nor throttle the animal. He released it, and it plunged wildly away, with tail between its legs,
        and still snarling. It halted forty feet away and surveyed him curiously, with ears sharply pricked forward.

    </div>
    <div id="17" hidden>
        <br>
        And all the time the dog ran with him, at his heels.
        When he had recovered his breath and control, he sat up and
        entertained in his mind the conception of meeting death with dignity. With this new-found peace of mind came the
        first glimmerings of drowsiness. A good idea, he thought, to sleep off to death. It was like taking an
        anæsthetic. Freezing was not so bad as people thought. There were lots worse ways to die.
        He pictured the boys finding his body next day. Suddenly he found himself with them, coming along the trail and
        looking for himself. And, still with them, he came around a turn in the trail and found himself lying in the
        snow. He did not belong with himself any more, for even then he was out of himself, standing with the boys and
        looking at himself in the snow.
        Then the man drowsed off into what seemed to him the most comfortable and satisfying sleep he had ever known.
        The dog sat facing him and waiting. The brief day drew to a close in a long, slow twilight. But the man remained
        silent. Later, the dog whined loudly. And still later it crept close to the man and caught the scent of death.
        This made the animal bristle and back away. A little longer it delayed, howling under the stars that leaped and
        danced and shone brightly in the cold sky. Then it turned and trotted up the trail in the direction of the camp
        it knew, where were the other food-providers and fire-providers.
